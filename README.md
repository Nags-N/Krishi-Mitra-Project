## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or higher) and pip
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/DARSHANbrungi/Krishi-Mitra.git](https://github.com/DARSHANbrungi/Krishi-Mitra.git)
    cd Krishi-Mitra
    ```

2.  **Frontend Setup**
    Install all the necessary npm packages for the React application.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Backend (Python ML) Setup**
    This will set up the environment for the Flask API server.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install Python packages
    pip install Flask Flask-Cors pandas scikit-learn numpy
    ```

4.  **Firebase & External API Setup**
    You need to get API keys from a few services and provide them to the application.

    * **Create a `.env` file** in the **root** of the project. Copy the contents from the `.env.example` file below and fill in your keys.

    * **.env.example** (Copy this into your `.env` file)
        ```env
        # Firebase Configuration
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"

        # External APIs
        REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
        REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        
        # Cloudinary
        REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME"
        REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET"
        ```

5.  **Update Profile Page for `.env`**
    To keep all keys in one place, update `src/pages/ProfilePage.js` to read Cloudinary details from the `.env` file.
    * **Change these lines:**
        ```javascript
        const CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = "YOUR_CLOUD_NAME";
        const CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = "YOUR_UPLOAD_PRESET";
        ```
    * **To this:**
        ```javascript
        const CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = process.env.REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME;
        const CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = process.env.REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET;
        ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

To run the full application, you need **two separate terminals** running at the same time.

### **Terminal 1: Start the Python ML Backend**
This server handles the crop recommendation requests.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend folder from the project root
cd backend

# (If you created a virtual environment, activate it first)
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Run the API server
python api.py
